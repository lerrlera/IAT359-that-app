# Transition House Availability Tracker (THAT)

The app provides real-time information on the availability of nearby transition houses. Users can view all shelters on a map and see which ones currently have space. This helps individuals quickly find safe, temporary housing. At the same time, it reduces the communication burden on shelter staff, who no longer need to respond to multiple availability inquiries.
